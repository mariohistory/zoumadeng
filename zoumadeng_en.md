## Incident Summary

This article recounts in detail how the Douyu *Super Mario Maker* streamers **KazeLink (カゼリンク, now known as Bubuline)** and **Baipang (白白的胖胖呀 / シロパイ)** went from close partners to a tragic falling out — the background, the sequence of events, and the aftermath in which KazeLink returned to stream the same map in endless repetition, a cycle the audience came to call **“Zoumadeng (走馬灯, revolving lantern)”**.

---

### 1. The Bright Beginning

On Douyu, **KazeLink** and **Baipang** were once the twin stars of the *Super Mario Maker* world.
Their streams were the source of joy for countless fans. Their chemistry and camaraderie were legendary.

In that world built of code and dreams, **KazeLink** was the brilliant genius — sharp and dazzling.
**Baipang** was his gentle anchor. Together they conquered the hardest courses, and in late-night voice chats, they shared the kind of loneliness and longing they never showed the world.

> “We’re not partners — we’re one,” KazeLink once said.
> Baipang smiled, and the faint light from the screen reflected in his eyes like scattered stars.

### 2. The Separation

The turning point came with an invitation to Tokyo.
KazeLink went alone. At first, he still connected with Baipang in late-night calls, describing the foreign streets and the promise of new beginnings.
But soon the calls turned to messages, and the messages grew sparse.

Baipang remained in their shared Douyu room, facing the same familiar audience alone.
He smiled as always, replaying their old *Mario Maker* maps, as if by doing so he could preserve their bond.

Until one day, he saw a post —
a photo of **KazeLink** with a **Japanese girl**, his arm around her shoulders, smiling in a way Baipang hadn’t seen in a long time — a smile of peace, of freedom.

Then came the final message from KazeLink:

> “I’m sorry. I’ve found a new life, and someone I want to protect.
> The stream... and everything from before — let’s end it here.”

No explanations. No farewell.
The account vanished. All contact blocked.
He evaporated like a drop of water into the neon haze of Tokyo.

Baipang didn’t cry. He just quietly closed his stream.

### 3. The Creation of *Zoumadeng (走馬灯)*

He returned to the *Super Mario Maker* editor where it had all begun —
the place filled with their shared memories.

He rebuilt one of their earliest courses, but this time, every jump carried a memory of their teamwork;
every trap, a reflection of the hidden pain behind their smiles;
every note block, a piece of their old melody.

He titled the map **“Zoumadeng” (走馬灯 / Revolving Lantern)**.

He never streamed again. He simply worked on the course in silence.
Months later, he uploaded it with a single line:

> “In memory of a dream that never woke.”

Then he disappeared too.

### 4. The Eternal Loop

Years passed.
In the archives of Douyu history, that course remained —
**no one ever cleared it**.

Some players claimed that upon reaching the end, they heard a faint laugh.
A digital whisper, fragile as wind —
a sound that could be either vengeance or a dream that refused to fade.

### 5. The Return of KazeLink — as Bubuline

When most had forgotten, a new streamer named **bubuline** quietly appeared on **Douyin (TikTok China)**.
His room number was different, but old viewers recognized that style instantly —
the same intensity, the same spirit.

**He had returned.**
But now, he seemed weary — carrying the weight of regret.

He no longer speedran or talked about Baipang.
He did just one thing:
opened that old game and **played “Zoumadeng” every single day.**

No commentary.
Only the sound of his controller and the echo of old memories.

He moved through the traps and jumps with perfect precision.
At certain places, he would intentionally fall — and restart without a word.
At others, he’d pause before a wall where a hidden easter egg once held their photo — staring in silence for a few seconds.

Viewers understood everything without him saying a word.
It was no longer gameplay — it was **penance**.

---

### 6. The Final Lantern

He played endlessly, looping through the course like a soul trapped in memory —
seeking the shadow of someone long gone,
repenting for a goodbye that could never be undone.

His Douyin stream title read:

> “Daily Zoumadeng” 

It became both the name of his stream — and the epitaph of his life.

Some say the laugh once heard at the end of the map
can now be heard at the very beginning.
It no longer comes from the game —
but from the streamer himself.

A sigh.
A faint, human echo inside a looping digital dream.

He had turned his own life
into the final, and longest, **Zoumadeng (走馬灯)** of all.
